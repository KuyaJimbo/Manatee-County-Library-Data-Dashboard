"11705511","Author Talk: Three Ringling Circus, by Sandra Gurvis","Sarasota would not be what it is today without the influence of the Ringling family, particularly John Ringling and his wife Mable. 

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.

"11390507","Author Talk: Three Ringling Circus, by Sandra Gurvis","Sarasota would not be what it is today without the influence of the Ringling family, particularly John Ringling and his wife Mable. 

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.

"11372705","Author Talk: Three Ringling Circus by Sandra Gurvis","Sarasota would not be what it is today without the influence of the Ringling family, particularly John Ringling and his wife Mable. 

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.

"11502988","Palmetto Friends of the Library Book Club - The Wish by Nicholas Sparks","1996 was the year that changed everything for Maggie Dawes. Sent away at sixteen to live with an aunt she barely knew in Ocracoke, a remote village on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, she could think only of the friends and family she left behind . . . until she met Bryce Trickett, one of the few teenagers on the island. Handsome, genuine, and newly admitted to West Point, Bryce showed her how much there was to love about the wind-swept beach town—and introduced her to photography, a passion that would define the rest of her life.

By 2019, Maggie is a renowned travel photographer. She splits her time between running a successful gallery in New York and photographing remote locations around the world. But this year she is unexpectedly grounded over Christmas, struggling to come to terms with a sobering medical diagnosis. Increasingly dependent on a young assistant, she finds herself becoming close to him.

As they count down the last days of the season together, she begins to tell him the story of another Christmas, decades earlier—and the love that set her on a course she never could have imagined.

Birder She Wrote by Donna Andrews

Meg is relaxing in the hammock, taste-testing Michael’s latest batch of Arnold Palmers and watching the hummingbirds at their feeders when her hopes for a relaxing early summer morning are dashed.

First her father recruits her to help him install a new batch of bees in the hive in her backyard. Then Mayor Shiffley recruits her to placate the NIMBYs (Not in my backyard), as she calls them – a group of newcomers to Caerphilly who have built McMansions next door to working farms and then do their best to make life miserable for the farmers. And finally Meg’s grandmother, shows up, trailed by a nosy reporter who is writing a feature on her for a genteel Southern ladies’ magazine.

Cordelia drafts Meg to accompany her and Deacon Washington of the New Life Baptist Church – and the reporter, alas – in their search for a long-lost African-American cemetery. Unfortunately what they discover is not an ancient cemetery but a fresh corpse. Can Meg protect her grandmother – and Caerphilly – from the reporter who seems to see the worst in everything . . . and help crack the case before the killer finds another victim.

"12046841","Author Talk: Three Ringling Circus by Sandra Gurvis","Sarasota would not be what it is today without the influence of the Ringling family, particularly John Ringling and his wife Mable. 

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.

This class is for those who have attended the beginning drawing class as well as those who have a little experience in drawing. We will explore figurative art. Figurative art, sometimes written as figuratism, describes artwork (particularly paintings and sculptures) that is clearly derived from real object sources and so is, by definition, representational. Class #1 will focus on learning about drawing from life.

Students are encouraged to bring their own drawing supplies. Paper will be provided.

(Goodreads)Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, this is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.

"11602576","Creative Aging: Figurative Drawing Series","

This class is for those who have attended the beginning drawing class as well as those who have a little experience in drawing. We will explore figurative art. Figurative art, sometimes written as figuratism, describes artwork (particularly paintings and sculptures) that is clearly derived from real object sources and so is, by definition, representational. Class #1 will focus on learning about drawing from life.

Students are encouraged to bring their own drawing supplies. Paper will be provided.

Within an hour, however, a man will be murdered and his companion will be “disappeared.” An unlikely detective, Morgana Musgrove, doyenne of Savannah society, is called upon to unravel the mystery of these crimes.

"11602578","Creative Aging: Figurative Drawing Series","

This class is for those who have attended the beginning drawing class as well as those who have a little experience in drawing. We will explore figurative art. Figurative art, sometimes written as figuratism, describes artwork (particularly paintings and sculptures) that is clearly derived from real object sources and so is, by definition, representational. Class #1 will focus on learning about drawing from life.

Students are encouraged to bring their own drawing supplies. Paper will be provided.

This class is for those who have attended the beginning drawing class as well as those who have a little experience in drawing. We will explore figurative art. Figurative art, sometimes written as figuratism, describes artwork (particularly paintings and sculptures) that is clearly derived from real object sources and so is, by definition, representational. Class #1 will focus on learning about drawing from life.

Students are encouraged to bring their own drawing supplies. Paper will be provided.

Cat Me if You Can by Miranda James

Charlie and Diesel along with Charlie's fiancée, Helen Louise Brady, are heading to Asheville, North Carolina to spend a week at a boutique hotel and participate in a gathering of a mystery reader's club composed of patrons of the Athena Public Library. In addition to seeing the local sights, the members will take turns giving talks on their favorite authors. 

The always spry Ducote sisters, friends of the hotel’s owners, are helping underwrite the expenses, and they’ve insisted that Charlie, Helen, and Diesel join them. Anxious to get Helen Louise away from her bistro for a vacation, Charlie readily agrees. While Charlie is looking forward to relaxing with Helen Louise and Diesel, other members of the group have ulterior motives including a long-standing score to settle.

When an intrusive, uninvited guest turns up dead, only one mystery club member with a connection to the deceased appears to have a motive to kill. But could the answer really be that simple? Charlie and Diesel, along with the detecting Ducote sisters, know that every murder plot has an unexpected twist.

Each class will close with a recap of the lesson, questioning the students about what they just learned, including new vocabulary and to give homework or recommendations to improve their pronunciation or grammar.

"12204423","Author Talk: Three Ringling Circus by Sandra Gurvis","Sarasota would not be what it is today without the influence of the Ringling family, particularly John Ringling and his wife Mable. 

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.

"11520169","Book Discussion Group: Yellowface, by R.F. Kuang","Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars: same year at Yale, same debut year in publishing. But Athena's a cross-genre literary darling, and June didn't even get a paperback release. Nobody wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks. So when June witnesses Athena's death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena's just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers to the British and French war efforts during World War I. So what if June edits Athena's novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song--complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn't this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That's what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree. But June can't get away from Athena's shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June's (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.

Josie, it turns out, is also celebrating her forty-fifth birthday. They are, in fact, birthday twins. A few days later, Alix and Josie bump into each other again, this time outside Alix’s children’s school. Josie has been listening to Alix’s podcasts and thinks she might be an interesting subject for her series. Josie’s life appears to be strange and complicated, and although Alix finds her unsettling, she can’t quite resist the temptation to keep making the podcast. Slowly she starts to realize that Josie has been hiding some very dark secrets, and before she knows it, Josie has inveigled her way into Alix’s life—and into her home. But, as quickly as she arrived, Josie disappears. Only then does Alix discover that Josie has left a terrible and terrifying legacy in her wake, and that Alix has become the subject of her own true crime podcast, with her life and her family’s lives under mortal threat. Who is Josie Fair? And what has she done?

"12311513","Dollar-A-Day Boys: A Musical Tribute to the Civilian Conservation Corps","Did you know that the Civilian Conservation Corps built 15 Florida State Parks?

The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a voluntary government work relief program that ran from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men ages 18–25 and eventually expanded to ages 17–28. A major part of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal, the CCC supplied manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state, and local governments to alleviate the effects of The Great Depression. (Wikipedia)

Entertainment Historian, Bill Jamerson, will discuss the CCC and provide a musical tribute to the boys of the CCC. According to him, ""the story of the CCC has universal appeal because it's about underdogs who are given a second chance."" Jamerson's presentation has been described as a cross between Woody Guthrie and Garrison Keillor. It's the oral tradition of sharing our national stories with humor, storytelling, and song.

The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a voluntary government work relief program that ran from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men ages 18–25 and eventually expanded to ages 17–28. A major part of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal, the CCC supplied manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state, and local governments to alleviate the effects of The Great Depression. (Wikipedia)

Entertainment Historian, Bill Jamerson, will discuss the CCC and provide a musical tribute to the boys of the CCC. According to him, ""the story of the CCC has universal appeal because it's about underdogs who are given a second chance."" Jamerson's presentation has been described as a cross between Woody Guthrie and Garrison Keillor. It's the oral tradition of sharing our national stories with humor, storytelling, and song.

"11520170","Book Discussion Group: Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson","September 8, 1900, began innocently in the seaside town of Galveston, Texas. Even Isaac Cline, resident meteorologist for the U.S. Weather Bureau failed to grasp the true meaning of the strange deep-sea swells and peculiar winds that greeted the city that morning. Mere hours later, Galveston found itself submerged in a monster hurricane that completely destroyed the town and killed over six thousand people in what remains the greatest natural disaster in American history--and Isaac Cline found himself the victim of a devastating personal tragedy. Using Cline's own telegrams, letters, and reports, the testimony of scores of survivors, and our latest understanding of the science of hurricanes, Erik Larson builds a chronicle of one man's heroic struggle and fatal miscalculation in the face of a storm of unimaginable magnitude. Riveting, powerful, and unbearably suspenseful, Isaac's Storm is the story of what can happen when human arrogance meets the great uncontrollable force of nature. (Goodreads)

Focusing on two main “characters,” John Ringling and his family, and the city of Sarasota, THREE RINGLING CIRCUS is divided into three sections: The history of Sarasota, the story of the Ringlings and the Ringling effect on the city.  The book covers everything from the early days of the natives, Blacks and settlers to the origins of the Ringling family and ahead-of-their-time ways of developing their circus to the massive amounts of finagling that went into the creation of the Art Museum and Ca d’Zan. The book bears witness to the Ringlings’ fabulous lifestyle, their behind-the-scenes heartbreak and triumph and often Machiavellian grab for wealth and power.","2024-05-20","2024-05-20","18:00","19:00","17:30","19:30","Meeting Room","South Manatee Branch Library","David Breakfield, South Manatee Library Supervisor","Sandra Gurvis","Adults (18+)","Literacy > Book Clubs & Author Talks","Published","","","Yes","25","0","6","0","0","0","5","","0","https://manateelibrary.libcal.com/event/12348703"

"12513670","The Women: A Vietnam Army Nurse's Response","In celebration of Women Veteran Day, please join us on June 13th from 2-3 pm for a lecture by Colonel Lorna House, U.S. Army Nurse Corps, retired. This program will highlight women who served in the armed forces in Vietnam alongside a discussion about The Women by author, Kristin Hannah. 

The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era. Credit: Goodreads

**Please note: capacity is set at 84 participants. Please join us again for an additonal presentation on Women in the U.S. Military on Thursday, June 27th from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm**

"12207797","'Murder by the Book' Book Club: Sworn to Silence, by Linda Castillo","In the sleepy rural town of Painters Mill, Ohio, the Amish and “English” residents have lived side by side for two centuries. But sixteen years ago, a series of brutal murders shattered the peaceful farming community. In the aftermath of the violence, the town was left with a sense of fragility, a loss of innocence. Kate Burkholder, a young Amish girl, survived the terror of the Slaughterhouse Killer but came away from its brutality with the realization that she no longer belonged with the Amish. Now, a wealth of experience later, Kate has been asked to return to Painters Mill as chief of police. Her Amish roots and big city law enforcement background make her the perfect candidate. She’s certain she’s come to terms with her past―until the first body is discovered in a snowy field. Kate vows to stop the killer before he strikes again. But to do so, she must betray both her family and her Amish past―and expose a dark secret that could destroy her.

"12198529","Palmetto Friends of the Library Book Club - The Henna Artist by Alka Joshi","Vivid and compelling in its portrait of one woman’s struggle for fulfillment in a society pivoting between the traditional and the modern, The Henna Artist opens a door into a world that is at once lush and fascinating, stark and cruel.

Escaping from an abusive marriage, seventeen-year-old Lakshmi makes her way alone to the vibrant 1950s pink city of Jaipur. There she becomes the most highly requested henna artist—and confidante—to the wealthy women of the upper class. But trusted with the secrets of the wealthy, she can never reveal her own…

Known for her original designs and sage advice, Lakshmi must tread carefully to avoid the jealous gossips who could ruin her reputation and her livelihood. As she pursues her dream of an independent life, she is startled one day when she is confronted by her husband, who has tracked her down these many years later with a high-spirited young girl in tow—a sister Lakshmi never knew she had. Suddenly the caution that she has carefully cultivated as protection is threatened. Still she perseveres, applying her talents and lifting up those that surround her as she does.

Walking home together after the meal, they watch in horror as Stephen is knocked down and critically injured in what Gamache knows is no accident, but a deliberate attempt on the elderly man's life. When a strange key is found in Stephen's possession it sends Armand, his wife Reine-Marie, and his former second-in-command at the Sûreté, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, from the top of the Tour d'Eiffel, to the bowels of the Paris Archives, from luxury hotels to odd, coded, works of art.

"13087379","Art Talk: Claude Monet & Impressionism","Claude Monet was an Impressionist painter who started out in painting in Normandy. He painted for over 80 years and his painting Impressions: Sunrise gave the name to Impressionism. Learn about the roots of Impressionism, Monet’s use of color, his critical relationship with his brother, who gave Monet a leg up on all the other Impressionists. One hundred years before Andy Warhol, Claude Monet serialized his painting, painting large series of landscapes at Etretat, haystacks, poplar trees, church facades under different light and finally water lilies in a pond. His final works in the 1920s set the stage for the artistic revolution called Modern Art. *Sponsored by the Friends of the Island Library*

The book follows the author's father, Kenneth, from birth. He grows to adulthood during some of the darkest times of the 20th century. As Kenneth reaches adulthood, he makes decisions and choices about his life going forward. After high school graduation he is faced with decisions regarding college and going to work in a full-time job. And then, a call to duty when World War Two begins. Turning points which all evolve within a year. The twenty-five-year clock starts ticking. Kenneth starts his journey with the Navy. He serves in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Wars. Life takes him from North Africa to the coast of Indochina. Actual stories from his war diary; the humorous, the tedious, as well as the grim, are retold. After the war he returns to his hometown where he meets the woman who will become his wife. We follow his life further. His Conversion to Catholicism. His marriage. His homes. His cars. His nieces. His nephews. His hopes and his dreams. And then, finally, children of his own. Time's up. The story unfolds during an age of innocence. ","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","18:00","19:30","","","Auditorium","Palmetto Branch Library","Chelsea B. - Manatee County Public Library","Michael Berquist","Adults (18+)","Literacy > Book Clubs & Author Talks","Published","Friends-funded","","Yes","50","0","6","0","1","0","9","","0","https://manateelibrary.libcal.com/event/12760782"

In six weeks, more than twenty thousand Hungarian Jews were forcefully deported to Galicia and summarily executed. In exploring the fate of these Hungarian Jews and their local coreligionists, A Summer of Mass Murder transcends conventional history by introducing a multitude of layers of politics, culture, and, above all, psychology―for both the victims and the executioners. Dr. George Eisen discusses his latest book and the chain of events that led to the writing of this hitherto untold chapter of the Holocaust.","2024-11-07","2024-11-07","18:00","19:00","","","Meeting Room 102","Braden River Branch Library","Cathy L. - Manatee County Public Library","George Eisen","Adults (18+)","History & Genealogy, Literacy > Book Clubs & Author Talks","Published","County-funded","","Yes","80","0","9","0","3","0","11","","0","https://manateelibrary.libcal.com/event/12737439"

Joe Pickett could just make out down below a figure in the snow and timber, and then three other figures closing in. There was nothing he could do about it. And Joe knew that he might be their next target. The Cates family had always been a bad lot. Game warden Joe Pickett had been able to strike a fierce blow against them when the life of his daughter April had been endangered, but he’d always wondered if there’d be a day of reckoning. He’s not wondering any longer. Joe knows they’re coming after him and his family now. He has his friend Nate by his side, but will that be enough this time? All he can do is prepare . . . and wait for them to make the first move.

Each month, we will discuss a book focused on mental and physical wellness and alternate between fitness trail walks and yoga sessions. In partnership with the Sports and Leisure Department, this program not only fosters community connections but also invites you to discover the beautiful county parks in our area.

This month's book: Braving the Wilderness, Brene Brown

“True belonging doesn’t require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are.” Social scientist Brené Brown, PhD, MSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives—experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging. (Amazon)

This month's book: Better than Before, by Gretchen Rubin

Most of us have a habit we’d like to change, and there’s no shortage of expert advice. But as we all know from tough experience, no magic, one-size-fits-all solution exists. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives. (Amazon)

SPAF saw an opportunity to provide arts wellness programs to help support our community in this time of rebuilding. SPAF Foundation has been providing therapeutic and reflective arts workshops in partnership with The Resilient Retreat since 2020, with participants continuously citing the workshops as teaching new skills and lowering stress.

This interactive experience explores various world instruments and sounds, such as singing bowls, tuning forks, chimes, steel drums, world percussion, and voice. The program is conducted in three phases: 1. Educate participants about the principles of sound therapy, its benefits, and how to integrate sound healing into daily life—discovering their why. 2. Healing Sound Bath allows the participants to experience meditation and a relaxing environment. (Facilitator plays the instruments) 3. Allow the participants to play the instrument, recognizing their synchronization with the energy and compatibility of the instruments.

"13597907","Adult Arts Wellness Workshop: Becoming Picasso, presented by the Sarasota Performing Arts Foundation (SPAF)","This initiative is in response to the recent devastation from Hurricane's Helene and Milton. SPAF saw an opportunity to provide arts wellness programs to help support our community in this time of rebuilding. SPAF Foundation has been providing therapeutic and reflective arts workshops in partnership with The Resilient Retreat since 2020, with participants continuously citing the workshops as teaching new skills and lowering stress.

This workshop offers a transformative experience, empowering participants to expand their capacity to know and understand themselves. Through a series of engaging exercises inspired by theater directors Boal and Stanislavski, as well as ancient wisdom from the Yoga Sutras, participants will actively explore and challenge their thoughts, uncovering the ones that masquerade as facts and significantly influence their behaviors. By taking an inventory of their consciousness, examining their intelligence, outer mind, senses, and ego, participants will break free from habitual thinking patterns and step into the vast space of infinite possibilities in the present moment. This workshop brings together a wealth of knowledge and expertise. Tap into your inner Picassos, discovering your unique creative potential and embarking on a personal journey of self-discovery.

"12737583","Adult Book Discussion Group: Birnam Wood by Kazuo by Eleanor Catton","Five years ago, Mira Bunting founded a guerrilla gardening group: Birnam Wood. An undeclared, unregulated, sometimes-criminal, sometimes-philanthropic gathering of friends, this activist collective plants crops wherever no one will notice: on the sides of roads, in forgotten parks, and neglected backyards. For years, the group has struggled to break even. Then Mira stumbles on an answer, a way to finally set the group up for the long term: a landslide has closed the Korowai Pass, cutting off the town of Thorndike. Natural disaster has created an opportunity, a sizable farm seemingly abandoned. But Mira is not the only one interested in Thorndike.
